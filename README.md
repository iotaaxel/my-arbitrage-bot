# My Arbitrage Bot

## Option 1:

### Overview

- Here's an example of how you could create an arbitrage bot using React and Java:
### How it works:

The React frontend retrieves the list of arbitrage opportunities from the Java backend.
The user can opt-in to accept the bot decisions or manually respond to the trade opportunities.
If the user opts-in, the bot will automatically initiate the trade if the opportunity still exists.
If the user manually responds, the bot will initiate the trade only if the user's response matches the trade opportunity.
The Java backend initiates the trade and returns a success message to the React frontend.
Note: This is a basic example, and you will need to implement the actual logic for retrieving arbitrage opportunities and initiating trades. Additionally, you will need to modify the React frontend to display the trades in a user-friendly format.
